# The Movie Dock

It is my first Redux project. In this project the data is been fetched from https://www.omdbapi.com/ .
After fetching the data from home page the data is pushed to the initail redux state using dispatch method.
Movie Listing file is using useSelector method to get the data from the reducer.
